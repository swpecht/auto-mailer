Auto-Mailer
============

This program aims to create an easy way to send automatd emails to members of a list based on predefined criteria.

The basic use case was to send members reminders and instructions for registering for grad school based on their reported course-plan.

Functionality
-------------

To speed development of the application, the current plan is to use google docs spread sheets to control data entry and sharing for data entry and proggamatically access this data through python to send the actual emails.
